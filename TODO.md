# Plagentic Development Roadmap

## Primary Goal: CI/CD Infrastructure Automation Platform

Plagentic aims to become the standard for AI-driven infrastructure provisioning, replacing traditional Infrastructure-as-Code tools with intelligent, conversational infrastructure management.

**Target CI/CD Usage:**
```bash
# In CI/CD pipelines:
docker run --rm \
  -v ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml \
  -v ./teams:/app/teams \
  plagentic plagentic run infrastructure-team -t "Provision staging environment"
```

## Immediate Priorities

### 1. SDK Usability and Publishing
**Status: TODO**
- [ ] Package SDK for PyPI distribution
- [ ] Create comprehensive SDK documentation with examples
- [ ] Add SDK testing examples for team usage (aws-infrastructure, gcp-infrastructure)
- [ ] Simplify import structure for better developer experience
- [ ] Add type hints and better IDE support

### 2. Advanced Agent Architecture
**Status: TODO**
- [ ] Integrate LangGraph for sophisticated multi-agent workflows
- [ ] Implement LangChain compatibility for ecosystem integration
- [ ] Add agent coordination patterns (sequential, parallel, hierarchical)
- [ ] Create agent memory and context persistence
- [ ] Implement failure recovery and retry mechanisms

### 3. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration
**Status: TODO**
- [ ] Design MCP interface for cloud resource management
- [ ] Implement MCP connectors for AWS, Azure, GCP
- [ ] Create standardized cloud operation protocols
- [ ] Move beyond research tools to real infrastructure automation
- [ ] Add infrastructure state management and drift detection

### 4. Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Support
**Status: TODO**
- [ ] Robust AWS support (EC2, VPC, EKS, RDS, Lambda)
- [ ] Azure support (VM, VNET, AKS, SQL Database, Functions)
- [ ] GCP support (Compute Engine, VPC, GKE, Cloud SQL, Cloud Functions)
- [ ] Terraform CLI integration for existing infrastructure
- [ ] CloudFormation and ARM template generation
- [ ] Infrastructure validation and compliance checking

## Future Vision

### Enterprise Features
**Status: PLANNED**
- [ ] Advanced team management and role-based access control
- [ ] Enterprise security and compliance features
- [ ] Audit trails and infrastructure change tracking
- [ ] Integration with existing enterprise tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Cost optimization and resource management recommendations

### Cloud-Native Architecture
**Status: PLANNED**
- [ ] Golang implementation for Kubernetes and cloud-native workflows
- [ ] Hybrid Python/Go architecture for scalability
- [ ] Kubernetes operator for cluster-based infrastructure management
- [ ] Helm chart distribution for easy deployment
- [ ] Service mesh integration (Istio, Linkerd)

### Advanced Capabilities
**Status: PLANNED**
- [ ] Infrastructure testing and validation frameworks
- [ ] Disaster recovery and backup automation
- [ ] Multi-region deployment strategies
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code generation from natural language
- [ ] Real-time infrastructure monitoring and alerting integration
